###The Menace reconstruction

What follows is a reconstruction of the Amiga game Menace, originally coded in 68000 assembler by David Jones of DMA Design, and published by Psygnosis in 1988. This version was coded by Jimmy Maher in 2010, and may be freely distributed.

This program was developed with Lattice C 5.02 running under KickStart and Workbench 1.3, and therefore should be certain compile successfully in that environment. This Github-hosted version was modified to compile under SAS/C 6.58 without any warning nor error.

This code is best understood in tandem with Chapter 8 of my book "The Future Was Here: The Commodore Amiga," which describes its techniques at a much higher level of abstraction than the comments which follow in the source proper.
